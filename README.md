# Tic Tac Toe

## Project concept

An application recreating the class Tic Tac Toe game. A great, quick game for two friends who want to play Tic Tac Toe without a piece of paper. I find this project interesting because I played Tic Tac Toe often in elementary school when I should have been doing my work.
