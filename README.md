# Tic Tac Toe

## Project concept

An application recreating the class Tic Tac Toe game. A great, quick game for two friends who want to play Tic Tac Toe without a piece of paper. I find this project interesting because I played Tic Tac Toe often in elementary school when I should have been doing my work.

## User stories

- As a user, I want to be able to undo placing a tile.
- As a user, I want to be able to clear the board and start a new game.
- As a user, I want to be able to see the current state of the board.
- As a user, I want to know when the game results in a win or draw.
- As a user, I want to be able to save my progress to a file.
- As a user, I want to be able to load from progress from a file.
